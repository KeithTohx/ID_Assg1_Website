This project is about building a Personal Portfolio Site for recruiters to consider hiring me. 

## Design Process
This webiste is intented for potential employers looking to hire, hence it is designed in a way to present myself in the best light and get hired by them. This website showcases information about myself, such as my education history and skillsets, projects that I have done, as well as my achievements.

User Stories:
* As a user type, I want to get in touch with the site's owner, so that I can invite him/her for an interview.
* As a user type, I want to get to know more about the site's owner, so that I can hire the most suitable person.

## Features
* Users can use the navigation bar located on the top of the page to travel between a total of 4 pages
* Users can directly connect with me via LinkedIn, Email or Instagram by clicking on the buttons at the bottom of the Home page. Users will be brought to a seperate tab with either LinkedIn, their Email or Instagram opened.
* The background colour of the website and the layout of some contents will change depending on the size of the screen the user is using to view the website. 

## Testing
As mentioned above, the background colour of the website will change depending on the screen size.
* Navigation bar will turn into grey and contents background will turn into dark grey when website is viewed on large screens such as desktop.
* Navigation bar will turn into dark green and contents background will turn into dark cyan when website is viewed on small screens such as smartphones.
