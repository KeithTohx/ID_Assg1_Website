# ID_Assg1_Website by Keith Toh
This project is about building a Personal Portfolio Site for recruiters to consider hiring me. 

## Design Process
This webiste is intented for potential employers looking to hire, hence it is designed in a way to present myself in the best light and get hired by them. This website showcases information about myself, such as my education history and skillsets, projects that I have done, as well as my achievements.

User Stories:
* As a user type, I want to get in touch with the site's owner, so that I can invite him/her for an interview.
* As a user type, I want to get to know more about the site's owner, so that I can hire the most suitable person.

## Features
* Users can use the navigation bar located on the top of the page to travel between a total of 4 pages
* Users can directly connect with me via LinkedIn, Email or Instagram by clicking on the buttons at the bottom of the Home page. Users will be brought to a seperate tab with either LinkedIn, their Email or Instagram opened.
* The background colour of the website and the layout of some contents will change depending on the size of the screen the user is using to view the website. 

## Testing
As mentioned above, the background colour of the website will change depending on the screen size.
* When viewed on a large screen (desktop), the overall theme of the website will be dark mode. In other words, the background colour of the navigation bar and contents will turn into different tones of grey.
* When viewed on a small screen (smartphone), the overall theme will be light mode. The background colour of the navigation bar and contents will turn into light grey and white respectively. The layout of some contents will also change to fill up the width of the display.
